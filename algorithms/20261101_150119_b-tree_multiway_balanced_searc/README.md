# B-Tree Multiway Balanced Search Tree Node Splitter (Python)

> A clean, dependency-free **Python** reference implementation of **B-Tree Multiway Balanced Search Tree Node Splitter**, focused on core algorithmic mechanics, clear memory layout, and test verification.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **B-Tree Multiway Balanced Search Tree Node Splitter**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Node Pointers & Self-Balancing Trees` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Execution Guarantees**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(1)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O(log N)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(N)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.py` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
python3 main.py
```

> ### 🔬 Module Engineering Origin & Verification Disclaimer
> **Algorithmic Origin & Operational Risk Allocation:**
> - **Autonomous Algorithmic Synthesis:** The implementation of `B-Tree Multiway Balanced Search Tree Node Splitter` in `Python`, including accompanying unit tests, harnesses, and build scripts, was synthesized via an autonomous AI engineering agent directed by system-level prompt specifications.
> - **Verification Scope:** Correctness assertions are derived solely from deterministic test execution and deterministic test suites. The maintainer governs the testing parameters and algorithmic criteria.
> - **ASSUMPTION OF OPERATIONAL RISK:** THIS MODULE IS DISTRIBUTED AS AN OPEN ALGORITHMIC STUDY. THE MAINTAINER DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR PRODUCTION WORKLOADS. USERS ASSUME COMPLETE LIABILITY FOR VALIDATING MEMORY SAFETY, THREAD SAFETY, CONCURRENCY HAZARDS, AND SECURITY INTEGRITY PRIOR TO PRODUCTION INTEGRATION.

# Path Decompositions of Sparse Graphs via Gaussian Sweeps and Faster Exponential Algorithms in Chronos-Interpreter

An in-memory reference implementation of **Path Decompositions of Sparse Graphs via Gaussian Sweeps and Faster Exponential Algorithms** in **Chronos-Interpreter**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

## Implementation Details

* **Category**: `Graph Topology & Traversal`
* **Data Structure Foundation**: `Adjacency List & Priority Heap`
* **Allocation Pattern**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Invariant Integrity**: Encapsulates state within isolated data structures, keeping logic self-contained.

## Performance Characteristics

* **Time**: `O((V + E) log V)` average, with `O(V + E)` best-case response under ideal conditions.
* **Space**: `O(V + E)` memory usage.

## Test Harness

To compile and execute the test assertions for this module:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

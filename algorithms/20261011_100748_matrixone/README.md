# Matrixone

An in-memory reference implementation of **Matrixone** in **Python**, adhering to standard library idioms, clean data structures, and assertion test suites.

---

## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Decisions

This module organizes `Matrixone` into an isolated, self-contained unit:
* **Domain Focus**: `Computational Mathematics & Transformation`
* **Primary Primitives**: `Lookup Tables & Bitwise Bitvectors`
* **Memory Strategy**: Buffer boundaries and collection indices are explicitly validated to prevent out-of-bounds access.
* **Correctness Model**: State consistency is verified after mutations through assertion test coverage.

### Asymptotic Complexity

| Metric | Bound | Characteristics |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Best Case Time** | `O(N log N)` | Optimized fast-path execution |
| **Average / Worst Time** | `O(N log N)` | Deterministic upper bound for generalized workloads |
| **Space Complexity** | `O(N)` | Strict bounds without unconstrained heap growth |

## 🧪 Verification Suite

The accompanying `main.py` driver executes self-contained verification tests:
1. **Nominal Flow**: Validates baseline correctness under typical real-world inputs.
2. **Boundary Conditions**: Exercises extreme edge cases (empty inputs, singletons, capacity limits).
3. **Invariant Preservation**: Validates internal state consistency throughout mutation lifecycles.

### Running Locally

```bash
python3 main.py
```

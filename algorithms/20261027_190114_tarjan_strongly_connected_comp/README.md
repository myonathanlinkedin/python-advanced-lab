# Tarjan Strongly Connected Components Search in Directed Graphs (Python)

> Self-contained **Tarjan Strongly Connected Components Search in Directed Graphs** algorithmic primitive written in idiomatic **Python**. Built from scratch using standard library constructs with zero external dependencies.

## Overview & Mechanics

The implementation focuses on the core mathematical properties of **Tarjan Strongly Connected Components Search in Directed Graphs**:
* **Data Organization**: Built upon `Adjacency List & Priority Heap` to ensure predictable traversal and storage overhead.
* **Safety Invariants**: Zero external heap dependencies; designed as a pure in-memory algorithmic component.
* **Execution Guarantees**: State transitions follow clear ordering guarantees with explicit validation at each phase.

## Complexity Profile

* **Time Complexity**:
  * Fast Path (Best): `O(V + E)`
  * Generalized (Avg / Worst): `O((V + E) log V)`
* **Space Footprint**: `O(V + E)` resident heap / stack overhead.

## Verification & Test Scenarios

The test suite in `main.py` validates:
* Standard operational paths against expected outcomes.
* Extreme values and edge inputs to ensure robust failure handling.
* State stability across sequential and repeated operations.

```bash
# Execute local verification runner
python3 main.py
```
